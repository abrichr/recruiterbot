Solutions Engineering coding exercise

This is Richard Abrich's solution to the
[Rasa coding exericse](https://gist.github.com/akelad/bf8486b5e92de9db438fca9dbbb1bce4).

Pipeline
- unpack default
- add SpacyNLP

ActionUtterPositions
- transforms positions to Title Case
- formats output according to number of positions available

ApplicationStatusForm
- requires PERSON slot to be filled from either an Entity or from text
  - can be filled in greeting
- utters only capitalized first name
- optionally forgets the applicant's name so that the user has to specify
  each time
